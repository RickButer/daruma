                A Daruma doll is a hollow, round, Japanese traditional doll modeled after Bodhidharma, the
                founder of the Zen tradition of Buddhism.<br /><br /> These dolls, though typically red and depicting a
                bearded man
                (Bodhidharma), vary greatly in color and design depending on region and artist.<br /><br /> Though
                considered a toy
                by some, Daruma has a design that is rich in symbolism and is regarded more as a talisman of good luck
                to the Japanese. Daruma dolls are seen as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, making them a popular
                gift of encouragement.<br /> The doll has also been commercialized by many Buddhist temples to use
                alongside
                the setting of goals.
